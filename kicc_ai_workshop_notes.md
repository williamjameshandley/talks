# KICC AI/ML Workshop Day - Planning Notes

**Date:** July 23rd, 2025, 10am-12pm  
**Location:** Hoyle Lecture Theatre + Zoom (recorded)  
**Organizers:** Will Handley, Miles Cranmer, Boris Bolliet, Vasily Belokurov

## Background
- Follow-up to successful Part II/III student training session (February 2025)
- Proposed by Sandro after staff expressed interest in hands-on AI tools experience
- Targeting faculty, postdocs, PhD students (PSS also welcome)
- Suitable for both beginners and seasoned users due to rapid evolution of tools

## Workshop Philosophy & Approach

### Core Principles (Will)
- **Cater to all levels** - start basic, then demo current workflows
- **Focus on "doing" not "explaining"** - tools & frameworks over theory
- **Show accessible tools** - prefer web interfaces over complex IDE setups
- **Multiple tool exposure** - don't get over-invested in any one system
- **Concrete recommendations** - provide immediate links for people to try

### Teaching Strategy (Miles)
- **Interactive demos essential** - show specific workflows in action
- **Hands-on experience priority** - better to know one tool than zero
- **Live coding demos** - e.g., "Let's add a feature to astropy" using Claude Code
- **Web interfaces first** - easier adoption than complex IDEs

## Tool Coverage Plan

### Three "Layers" of AI (Will's Framework)
1. **Autocomplete:** GitHub Copilot
2. **Prompt Engineering:** AI Studio, Gemini Deep Research
3. **Agentic Systems:** Claude Code

### Specific Tools to Demo
- **Claude Code** (Miles) - comprehensive workflow demonstration
- **Superwhisper** (Miles) - speech-driven coding (Mac required)
- **GitHub Copilot** (Will) - code completion
- **AI Studio/Gemini** (Will) - prompt engineering
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** (Will) - show concept, demo "MCPs writing MCPs"
- **Cursor** - mentioned but perhaps too IDE-specific for first session
- **Notebook LM** - suggested for consideration

### Research Workflows to Cover
- **Literature Review & Paper Reading**
  - Miles' approach: "drag PDF into ChatGPT and ask questions"
  - Will: Claude Code + grounded Gemini MCP
  - Boris: RAG implementations (Will noted he's behind on this)
- **Code Development**
  - Live astropy feature addition
  - Debugging and development workflows
- **Speech-Driven Coding**
  - Future of development interaction
  - Potential to replace traditional editors

## Technical Considerations

### MCP Discussion
- Will: Show concept first, then demo in action
- Avoid "MCPs writing MCPs" as too abstract for audience
- Consider simpler demos like GitHub MCP setup

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Immediately accessible** - one-click web interfaces preferred
- **Avoid over-specific recommendations** - let people explore on their own time
- **Show power through simplicity** - demonstrate capabilities without complexity

## Outstanding Questions & Areas to Develop

1. **Boris's RAG Contributions** - specific tools and workflows
2. **Literature Review Best Practices** - comparison of different approaches
3. **Advanced vs. Beginner Balance** - how much technical depth?
4. **Hands-on Time** - proportion of demo vs. participant practice
5. **Follow-up Resources** - what should people try immediately after?

## Key Insights from Planning Discussion

### Miles's Observations
- "Life is too short" for complex setups when simple solutions work
- Speech-driven coding as "near future" of development
- Getting people's "hands dirty with something" is key success metric
- Show tools that are "really only a click away"

### Will's Framework
- AI tools evolve weekly - teach concepts and adaptability
- Three-layer approach helps categorize vast tool landscape
- MCP understanding valuable for power users
- Balance showing current tools with teaching adaptability

## Next Steps
- [ ] Will to prepare intro slides for Monday feedback
- [ ] Coordinate specific tool demonstrations
- [ ] Finalize announcement to mailing lists (IoA, DAMTP, KICC, Cavendish AP)
- [ ] Set up Zoom recording and logistics
- [ ] Prepare concrete follow-up resources and links
