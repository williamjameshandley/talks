# Speaker Bio: Dr. Will Handley

**Dr. Will Handley** is a Royal Society University Research Fellow and Associate Professor at the University of Cambridge, based at the Institute of Astronomy and the Kavli Institute for Cosmology. He leads a research group (handley-lab.co.uk/group) at the intersection of fundamental physics and artificial intelligence, developing GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference methods for cosmology and astrophysics.

His group develops computational tools for astronomical data analysis, including PolyChord (a widely-used nested sampling algorithm and the foundation for PolyChord Ltd) and contributions to the BlackJAX framework for GPU-native inference. Their research spans cosmology (CMB, dark matter, dark energy), gravitational wave astrophysics, and 21-cm signals from the early universe, applying principled Bayesian methods to extract physical insights from complex datasets.

By combining classical statistical algorithms with modern GPU hardware and AI-assisted development, his group demonstrates that rigorous uncertainty quantification and substantial computational performance gains can coexist, positioning these methods as essential tools for astronomy's next-generation surveys like Rubin and SKA.
