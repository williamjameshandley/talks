# Notes on LMU-Cambridge Partnership

## Overview
The **LMU-Cambridge Strategic Partnership** is a formal collaboration between Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) and the University of Cambridge, established to strengthen research and education ties between two of Europe's leading universities (combined ~150 Nobel laureates).

## Partnership Structure
- **Duration**: Initial 5-year funding period
- **Scope**: Cross-disciplinary, covering all faculties
  - Humanities and Cultural Studies
  - Law, Economics, and Social Sciences  
  - Natural Sciences
  - Medicine
- **Activities**: Joint research, staff/student exchange, joint teaching, training programs

## Funding Mechanism
- Regular funding calls (most recent deadline: October 20, 2024)
- Supports Cambridge and LMU employees/students only
- Covers travel, collaboration costs, workshops

## Key Research Collaborations

### 1. Cambridge-LMU Cosmology Partnership (Since 2017)
**Most relevant to your field** - This is a flagship collaboration that:
- Combines Cambridge's CMB expertise with LMU's galaxy survey strengths
- Holds annual workshops (next: September 15-18, 2025 at LMU Munich)
- Focus areas:
  - Cross-correlation of CMB and galaxy survey data
  - Cosmological parameter estimation using galaxy cluster catalogues
  - Simulation-based inference of cosmic density fields
  - Primordial cosmological observables
  - Large-scale structure cosmology

### 2. "Researching Politics Online"
- Studies impact of internet/social media on 21st-century politics
- Digital methods and ethics research training

### 3. Student Exchange Programs
- 4-week programs for Cambridge and LMU students
- Learning opportunities at both institutions

## Recent Activities
- **2024**: Active funding cycle completed
- **2025**: Next cosmology workshop planned for September
- **Historical**: Regular workshops since 2017, including "The Non-Gaussian Universe" (2019)

## Strategic Significance
This partnership represents a world-leading collaboration in theoretical cosmology, bringing together "arguably the best known internationally" groups in both the UK and Germany. The cosmology partnership specifically leverages complementary expertise to advance the confrontation between cosmological theory and observation.
