# Simulation Based Inference: theory, sampling & model comparison

## Abstract
In this discursive talk, I will discuss the framework that SBI gives us for discussing problems in parameter estimation and model comparison, begining a discussion on possible pitfalls of amortised approaches. I also give a preview of a new approach to SBI we are developing based around linear mixture models, useful for both pedagogical and practical problems.
