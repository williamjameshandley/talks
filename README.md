# Frontiers in nested sampling

Invited talk given at [MaxEnt 2022](https://maxent22.see.asso.fr/) in Paris, 20th July 2022

## Abstract

In this talk I will give an overview of the state of the art and future research directions in the field of nested sampling~\cite{2004AIPC..735..395S}. Nested sampling is a numerical method for (a) scanning and optimising \textit{a priori} unknown functions (b) generating samples from probability distributions, and is uniquely capable of (c) computing high-dimensional numerical integrals and partition functions using \emph{probabilistic integration}. Implementations of John Skilling's nested sampling meta-algorithm include \texttt{MultiNest}~\cite{2009MNRAS.398.1601F}, \texttt{PolyChord}~\cite{2015MNRAS.453.4384H}, \texttt{NeuralNest}~\cite{2020MNRAS.496..328M}, \texttt{DNest}~\cite{2016arXiv160603757B}, \texttt{UltraNest}~\cite{2021JOSS....6.3001B} \& \texttt{dynesty}~\cite{2020MNRAS.493.3132S}. Whilst most of this headline literature implements variations on the mechanism for sampling from a likelihood-constrained prior, in the past two decades there have also been several advances in the content of the meta-algorithm and surrounding ecosystem of theory and numerical techniques. These include; dynamic nested sampling~\cite{2019S&C....29..891H}, diffusive nested sampling~\cite{2016arXiv160603757B}, quantifying parameter estimation errors~\cite{2018BayAn..13..873H}, post-processing cross-checks using \texttt{nestcheck}~\cite{2019MNRAS.483.2044H} and \texttt{anesthetic}~\cite{2019JOSS....4.1414H,2020MNRAS.497.5256F},  computing $p$-values in frequentist analyses~\cite{2022PhRvL.128b1801F} and using normalising flows to specify priors from previous posterior samples~\cite{2021MNRAS.505L..95A}. In my overview of future frontiers, I will discuss reversible nested sampling, using insertion indices or likelihood values rather than likelihood ordering for improved accuracy~\cite{2020MNRAS.497.5256F}, applying nested sampling in the field of likelihood-free and simulation-based inference~\cite{2016arXiv160603757B}, estimating the end of nested sampling, importance nested sampling, transdimensional nested sampling \& multi-objective nested sampling. Interest in collaborations for developing further any of the above will be warmly welcomed.
