# A Statistician's Guide to the Galaxy (Fitting Zoo)

## Abstract

An introduction to the statistical foundations of SED fitting, exploring the journey from simple optimization to sophisticated sampling methods. This talk covers the theoretical framework of Bayesian inference and demonstrates how different sampling algorithms—from MCMC to ensemble methods to nested sampling—tackle the challenge of exploring complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces in galaxy SED fitting. Special emphasis is placed on understanding when and why to use each method, with practical guidance on nested sampling for model comparison and evidence calculation.

The presentation includes live demonstrations using the Himmelblau test function to illustrate how gradient ascent, MCMC, ensemble sampling (emcee), and nested sampling each explore parameter space differently, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations for astronomical inference problems.
