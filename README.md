# Nested Sampling: A multi-purpose numerical tool for particle physics and cosmology

Invited talk given at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca) in Vancouver, Canada, 29th July 2022

## Abstract

Nested sampling [2205.15570](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00121-x) is an alternative MCMC technique for integrating and exploring probability distributions. With publicly available implementations such as MultiNest, PolyChord and dynesty, it has become widely adopted in the field of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics as a powerful tool for computing integrals and scanning and sampling challenging a-priori unknown parameter spaces.

In this talk I will give a user's introduction to the theory of nested sampling, and illustrate with recent novel applications in particle physics including: quantification of fine tuning [2101.00428](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2101.00428),[2205.13549](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2205.13549), fast computation of small p-values [2105.13923](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2105.13923) and exploration of phase space for computation of cross sections [2205.02030](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2205.02030). I will also discuss cosmological applications, in particular the deployment and calibration of the REACH 21cm radiometer [2207.XXXXX](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01709-9).
