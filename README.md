# Nested Sampling and Likelihood Free Inference

15 minute talk given on 21st April 2022 at [Likelihood-free in Paris](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/25496/)


## Abstract

Nested Sampling is an established numerical technique for optimising, sampling, integrating and scanning a priori unknown probability distributions. Whilst typically used in the context of traditional likelihood-driven Bayesian inference, it's capacity as a general sampler means that it is capable of exploring distributions on data [[2105.13923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13923)] and joint spaces [[1606.03757](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03757)].  

In this talk I will give a brief outline of the points of difference of nested sampling in comparison with other techniques, what it can uniquely offer in tackling the challenge of likelihood-free inference, and discuss ongoing work with collaborators in applying it in a variety of LFI-based approaches.
