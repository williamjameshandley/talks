# AI/ML Tools for Research

## Abstract

This workshop serves as a follow-up to the successful Part II/III student training session from February 2025, now targeting faculty, postdocs, and PhD students across IoA, DAMTP, KICC, and Cavendish AP. The session focuses on practical, hands-on experience with AI/ML tools for research workflows, emphasizing ``doing'' rather than ``explaining''.

The workshop introduces a three-layer framework for understanding AI tools:
1. **Autocomplete** (GitHub Copilot)  
2. **Chat-based AI** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini interfaces)
3. **Agentic Systems** (Claude Code, autonomous workflows)

Key demonstrations include comprehensive workflow examples, cost comparisons, and practical getting started guidance. The workshop addresses common questions researchers have about AI tools: which models to use, handling hallucinations, getting started effectively, and determining worthwhile investments in AI-assisted research workflows.

Designed for both beginners and experienced users due to the rapidly evolving nature of AI tools, the session prioritizes developer-level tools over consumer interfaces and provides concrete next steps for implementation in research workflows.
