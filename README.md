# Nested Sampling: A multi-purpose numerical tool for science and machine learning 

## Abstract

Nested sampling [2205.15570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15570) is a radical alternative to traditional MCMC techniques for integrating and exploring probability distributions. With publicly available implementations such as MultiNest, PolyChord and dynesty, it has become widely adopted across science as a powerful tool for computing integrals and scanning and sampling challenging a-priori unknown parameter spaces.

In this talk I will give a user's introduction to the theory of nested sampling, and illustrate with recent novel applications in particle physics, cosmology, Bayesian Neural Networks and beyond, with a specific case study in the deployment and calibration of the REACH 21cm radiometer [2210.07409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07409). I will finish with a discussion of recent innovations in the nested sampling toolkit, and prospects for the frontier of the field.
