# AI/ML Tools for Research

## Abstract

This workshop serves as a follow-up to the successful Part II/III student training session from February 2025, now targeting faculty, postdocs, and PhD students across IoA, DAMTP, KICC, and Cavendish AP. The session focuses on practical, hands-on experience with AI/ML tools for research workflows, emphasizing ``doing'' rather than ``explaining''.

The workshop introduces a three-layer framework for understanding AI tools:
1. **Autocomplete** (GitHub Copilot)  
2. **Chat-based AI** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini interfaces)
3. **Agentic Systems** (Claude Code, autonomous workflows)

Key demonstrations include comprehensive workflow examples, cost comparisons, and practical getting started guidance. The workshop addresses common questions researchers have about AI tools: which models to use, handling hallucinations, getting started effectively, and determining worthwhile investments in AI-assisted research workflows.

Designed for both beginners and experienced users due to the rapidly evolving nature of AI tools, the session prioritizes developer-level tools over consumer interfaces and provides concrete next steps for implementation in research workflows.

## Previous Training Session

This workshop builds on the February 2025 Part II/III student training session "An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models" by Vasily Belokurov, Will Handley, Miles Cranmer, and Boris Bolliet.

**Previous session covered:**
- Academic practice guidelines and Cambridge policies
- How LLMs work (statistical patterns, training, limitations)
- Bias, inaccuracy, hallucinations, and mitigation strategies
- Hidden AI in everyday tools (search, translation, reference management)
- Model landscape comparison (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open-source)
- Privacy considerations and data retention policies
- Intellectual property implications and copyright issues
- RAG systems (NotebookLM) for reducing hallucinations
- Responsible usage guidelines and common pitfalls
