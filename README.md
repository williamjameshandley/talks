# Nested sampling: powering next-generation inference and machine learning tools for astrophysics, cosmology, particle physics and beyond


## Abstract

Cosmological inference tools: marginal statistics and fully Bayesian forecasts.

I will present recent work on marginal inference tools and their use in cosmology: The marginal
KL divergence for comparing cosmological constraints between datasets, and the nuisance
marginalised likelihood for building fast, reusable libraries of likelihoods and priors for
unimpeded cosmological inference. These next-generation tools are enabled by the unique
combination of normalising flows and nested sampling [[2207.11457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457)].
 

In addition, I will discuss prescience: a fully Bayesian alternative to Fisher Forecasts
[[2309.06942](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06942)] using Jeffrey & Wandelt Evidence networks [[2305.11241](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11241)]. I will finish with
discussion of the features and limitations of evidence networks as a tool for Bayesian model
comparison.
