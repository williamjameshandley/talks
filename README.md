#  Resonant or asymmetric: The status of sub-GeV dark matter

## Abstract

Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates, but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this talk I will present GAMBIT results where we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints, and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.
