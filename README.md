# Nested Sampling with gradients: the present state of the art

## Abstract

Nested sampling [2205.15570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15570) is a radical alternative to traditional MCMC techniques for integrating and exploring probability distributions. With publicly available implementations such as MultiNest, PolyChord and dynesty, it has become widely adopted across science as a powerful tool for computing integrals and scanning and sampling challenging a-priori unknown parameter spaces.

In this talk I will give a high-level introduction to the theory and application of nested sampling, before discussing the state-of-the-art in using gradients in light of the advances in differentiable programming.
