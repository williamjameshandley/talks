# Next-generation inference tools for cosmology and beyond

As we approach a golden age of cosmological data, the need for reliable scientific inference tools has never been greater. In this talk I will give a survey of recent developments and applications of modern Bayesian inference in cosmology and beyond. I will begin with a summary of Nested sampling [4] as a robust, multi-purpose tool for the three pillars of Bayesian inference: cosmological parameter estimation, model comparison and tension quantification [5].  As example applications, I will discuss weak & strong likelihood-free nested sampling [1], marginal Bayesian statistics [3] and Fully Bayesian Forecasts [2]. I will finish with perspectives on the centrality of Simulation Based Inference (SBI) as a framework for (a) more
reliably and more efficiently extracting science from data, and (b) harnessing the power of
modern machine learning and AI techniques.
