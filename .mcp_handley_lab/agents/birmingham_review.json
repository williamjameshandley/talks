      "content": "Below is a structured review of will_handley.tex against the stated goals, the source files, and the intended audience/timebox. Slide numbers refer to the assembled talk will_handley.tex (Title = slide 1; slides 2–10 are the pedagogical foundation, 11–19 the GPU/applications section).\n\n1) Goal Achievement\n\nOverall: Largely achieves the README abstract goals. Strengths and gaps:\n\n- GPU computing for classical statistical methods\n  - Covered: Slides 11–13 explain GPU vs CPU (11), differentiate AD vs JIT/parallelization (12), and frame BlackJAX as a GPU-native framework with a unified view across algorithms (13).\n  - Gap: Minimal “how” details for porting classical code to GPU, and little hands-on “what to change in your code” content. Consider one practical slide with a minimal JAX/BlackJAX snippet and a brief “do/don’t” for GPU vectorization and JIT.\n\n- Differentiable programming frameworks (JAX, PyTorch) and two independent capabilities\n  - Covered well: Slide 12 makes the key point (free gradients vs GPU parallelization) explicit, names JAX/PyTorch et al., and emphasizes independence. This is central to the abstract and is done clearly.\n\n- BlackJAX framework applications with speedups (CMB/cosmic shear, GW)\n  - Covered well: Slides 14–17 present four case studies with concrete numbers and figures, consistent with caltech_2025.\n  - Minor mismatch with README: The README claims “300× for CMB/cosmic shear,” whereas the Cosmic Shear best comparison vs CPU is >1000× (ini_2025); the slide (14) says “Days vs months” and shows figures. Align numbers (see Improvements).\n\n- AI coding assistants for modernizing scientific software development\n  - Covered: Slide 18 conveys the key message (AI for code translation and the 80/20 rule). For a research audience, one concrete example would help (e.g., a 2–3 line “before/after” or a list of tools used by your group).\n\n- Case studies combining classical algorithms, GPU hardware, and AI-assisted development\n  - Covered: Case studies (slides 14–17) plus the AI slide (18) and the conclusions (19) meet this aim.\n\nVerdict: 80–90% of the abstract’s intent is reflected. The talk is strong on the pedagogy and on showcasing GPU results; it is lighter on “how to get started” and on practical migration tips.\n\n2) Accuracy Check (copying against source material)\n\n- Pedagogical section (slides 2–10) from sed_2025.tex:\n  - The content is faithfully adapted, generalized from SED to astronomy. Equations (posterior, evidence) and the key nested sampling concepts mirror sed_2025 slides 1–10.\n  - Images: You use the same figure sets (himmelblau_*). Early slides (2–10) reference .pdf files; later (slide 13) the file paths omit the .pdf extension (as in caltech_2025). Ensure both versions exist or unify extensions to avoid build issues.\n\n- “Method Comparison” summary table (sed_2025 slide 11) is omitted in will_handley. Consider re-adding it as a one-slide wrap-up of the pedagogical part (see Improvements).\n\n- GPU and BlackJAX/application section (slides 11–19) from caltech_2025.tex:\n  - Slide 11 (GPU computing), slide 12 (two capabilities), and slide 13 (BlackJAX multi-algorithm overlay) are near-identical and correctly transferred.\n  - Case studies 1–4 (slides 14–17) match caltech_2025: claims, figures, arXiv IDs, and bullets.\n  - AI coding slide (slide 18) matches caltech_2025 content/style.\n  - Conclusions (slide 19) are a hybrid of caltech_2025 conclusions with an added “Statistical foundations” first bullet; content is consistent with the rest.\n\n- Potential inconsistency/misleading phrasing on slide 13:\n  - Framesubtitles cycle through “Gradient descent,” “Metropolis-Hastings,” “emcee,” “Nested sampling,” and “HMC.” The bullets say “All algorithms GPU-accelerated” and “Unified interface,” which could be read as “BlackJAX implements emcee’s affine-invariant ensemble sampler.” BlackJAX provides HMC/NUTS/Metropolis/SMC, but not a drop-in emcee clone. Clarify to avoid implying BlackJAX includes emcee per se (see Improvements).\n\n- Minor stylistic inconsistency: Slide 9 title cites “Nested Sampling (e.g., dynesty),” but the rest of the talk advocates BlackJAX. That’s fine pedagogically but a short clarifier (dynesty for CPU, BlackJAX for GPU) would help.\n\n3) Pedagogical Flow\n\n- Flow: Optimization (4) → MCMC (6) → Ensemble (7) → Why evidence (8) → Nested sampling (9–10) → Hardware/software (11–13) → Applications (14–17) → AI (18) → Conclusions (19). This is a coherent ramp for a mixed audience. The “Why do sampling?” slide (5) sets up the rationale well.\n\n- Audience fit:\n  - Masters: Slides 2–10 are accessible and visual; good for on-ramp.\n  - PhD/postdocs/faculty: Slides 8–10 (evidence, nested sampling mechanics) and the GPU/applications provide substance, but could use one “rigor slide” to acknowledge the Beta(n,1) shrinkage result (see Technical Accuracy/Improvements) without going deep.\n\n- Suggested bridge: After slide 10, a one-slide transition that explicitly maps algorithmic structure to GPU patterns (e.g., parallel chains/live points/particles, vectorized likelihoods) will make the jump to hardware/software more explicit.\n\n4) Content Balance\n\n- Current split ≈ 50/50 (9 pedagogy + 9 GPU/apps; plus title).\n- For 30–40 minutes, 19 slides with heavy overlays on slide 13 (44 overlays) risks time overrun.\n- Recommendation:\n  - Slightly rebalance to 40% pedagogy / 60% GPU+applications, but primarily by compressing overlays, not by removing essential pedagogy.\n  - Keep pedagogy at ~12–14 minutes, GPU overview and BlackJAX at ~6–8 minutes, case studies at ~10–12 minutes, AI at ~2–3 minutes, conclusions + questions at ~3–5 minutes.\n\n5) Technical Accuracy\n\n- Bayesian identities: Correct. The identity log Z = E_p[log L] − D_KL(p||π) is valid.\n\n- Nested sampling “counting trick”:\n  - Slide 10’s V_{i+1} = V_i × n_inside/n_total is an intuitive description. The rigorous statement is that the shrinkage t_i ~ Beta(n_live, 1) with E[log t] = −1/n_live, independent of dimension/geometry. The “independent of dimensionality” comment is correct. Consider adding the Beta(n,1) footnote for faculty-level audience.\n\n- Algorithm characterizations:\n  - MCMC “can be inefficient with multimodality”: fair.\n  - Nested sampling “handles multimodality” and “no tuning required”: acceptable high-level claim (though kernel choice and reliability parameters still matter; you mention this elsewhere in original talks).\n  - Ensemble samplers: fair.\n\n- GPU claims:\n  - “GPU memory bandwidth ~10× faster” is a typical ballpark and fine as a heuristic, but varies by hardware. It’s fine in a talk; avoid implying an invariant constant.\n  - “GPU ≠ ML” separation of AD and parallelization is accurate and well-communicated.\n\n- Speedups:\n  - CMB: 300× vs CPU PolyChord (slide 14) matches source.\n  - Cosmic shear: “Days vs months” and the figure suggest >100×; in ini_2025 you state >1000× vs CPU and 10× vs an existing GPU approach. Consider harmonizing claims (see Improvements).\n  - GW: 20–40× (slide 17), consistent with caltech_2025.\n\n- BlackJAX coverage:\n  - Slide 13’s wording can be read as implying “BlackJAX = all algorithms listed, including emcee.” Clarify that “emcee-style affine-invariant sampling” is an algorithmic family you’re illustrating; BlackJAX offers its own set (HMC/NUTS/Metropolis/SMC and now nested sampling) on GPU.\n\n6) Improvements\n\na) Slide content and messaging\n\n- Add a summary table slide from sed_2025 (slide 11 there) immediately after your nested sampling mechanics (after slide 10). Title suggestion: “Choosing Your Tool: Summary.” This gives the mixed audience a crisp decision aid before moving to GPUs.\n\n- Add one bridge slide between slides 10 and 11: “Where do GPUs help in inference?”\n  - Bullets:\n    - Parallel chains (MCMC/SMC), parallel live points (NS)\n    - Vectorized likelihood evaluations across batches\n    - JIT-compilation and host/device transfer pitfalls to avoid\n    - Gradients are optional; they help HMC/NUTS but GPUs also help ensemble/NS.\n\n- Tighten slide 13 (BlackJAX overlay):\n  - Reduce overlays (e.g., show only 2–3 frames per algorithm family or precompile a short GIF/video).\n  - Edit bullets to avoid implying BlackJAX includes emcee specifically:\n    - Replace “All algorithms GPU-accelerated” with “All BlackJAX algorithms run on GPU; here we illustrate the landscape from optimization through nested sampling.”\n    - Optionally add: “Affine-invariant ensemble samplers (e.g., emcee) are a separate family we compare against.”\n  - If you want one explicit line of code, include a minimal BlackJAX NS/HMC snippet to anchor tangibility.\n\n- Harmonize speedup claims:\n  - Slide 14: Make CMB and cosmic shear claims apples-to-apples vs CPU and mention the GPU-vs-GPU comparison if relevant:\n    - Example bullets:\n      - CMB (6 params): 300× vs CPU PolyChord (1 hour → 12 s on A100)\n      - Cosmic shear (37 params): >1000× vs CPU baseline; ~10× vs existing GPU NUTS approach (12 A100 GPUs → 1 A100 in 4.5 hours) [ref arXiv].\n  - Update README if needed to say “CMB: 300×; Cosmic shear: >1000× vs CPU (10× vs prior GPU): …” for accuracy.\n\n- Optional rigor footnote on slide 10:\n  - Add a parenthetical: “Shrinkage factor t_i ~ Beta(n_live, 1) → E[log t] = −1/n_live.”\n\n- Consider adding a “Getting started” slide (from ini_2025/bristol_2025):\n  - “pip install git+https://github.com/handley-lab/blackjax”\n  - “Nested-sampling book: handley-lab.co.uk/nested-sampling-book”\n  - One-line code snippet initializing an NS run.\n\n- Consider a short slide on “Apples-to-apples” comparisons (ini_2025 had a good version):\n  - Cost/availability caveat: GPUs are rarer/more expensive in HPC queues; when you care about wall-clock vs cost; still, outcomes are often decisively better.\n\n- Minor edits:\n  - Slide 9 title currently cites “(e.g., dynesty)”. Consider adding “and GPU-native: BlackJAX” to maintain coherence with the rest of the talk.\n  - Slide 2 image is SED-like. That’s fine, but the text is generalized to astronomy. You could add a small caption: “Examples: SEDs, GW strain, CMB power spectra, shear correlation functions” to broaden the visual cue.\n\nb) Transitions between sections\n\n- Add the “Bridge” slide as above.\n- At slide 13, explicitly say “We’re not teaching each algorithm now; this is to show how BlackJAX covers the landscape on GPUs. Details in the book/references.”\n\nc) Emphasis and time allocation (30–40 minutes)\n\n- Suggested timing:\n  - Slides 2–5: 5–6 min\n  - Slides 6–10: 7–8 min\n  - Bridge slide: 1 min\n  - Slides 11–12: 3–4 min total\n  - Slide 13 (BlackJAX overlay): 3–4 min (only if overlays are reduced)\n  - Slides 14–17 (case studies): 10–12 min\n  - Slide 18 (AI dev): 2–3 min\n  - Slide 19 (Conclusions): 1–2 min\n  - Q&A: 3–5 min\n- To stay on time, the main risk is slide 13; compress overlays or pre-record animation.\n\nd) Additional material to include\n\n- One minimal code snippet for BlackJAX NS or HMC, to make the “JAX/BlackJAX” section more actionable for practitioners.\n- Practical note on GPU pitfalls: random number generation on device, host-device transfers, ensuring vmap/pmap use, and profiling JIT compile time vs run time.\n- Brief mention of PyTorch/NumPyro/Julia ecosystem alternatives, to anchor the “two capabilities across frameworks” message for a broad audience.\n\ne) Material to condense or remove\n\n- Slide 13 overlays (cut by >60%).\n- If needed, shorten the “Why do sampling?” bullet list by 1–2 items, retaining the golden rule f(E[X]) ≠ E[f(X)] point.\n\nPotential minor inconsistencies/risks to flag\n\n- “All algorithms GPU-accelerated” (slide 13) could be misread as “BlackJAX implements emcee.” Clarify wording as above.\n- README says “300× for CMB/cosmic shear.” Better: “CMB ~300×; cosmic shear >1000× vs CPU” to match the ini_2025 details and your figures.\n- Ensure figure file extensions are consistent across slides to prevent build issues (mix of .pdf vs no extension references).\n- The date is “TBD 2025” in the title slide; update to the Birmingham talk date.\n\nSummary\n\n- Strengths: Clear pedagogical progression, compelling GPU case studies with credible speedups, accurate message separating AD vs GPU parallelization, and a timely AI-development perspective.\n- Main fixes: Add a bridging slide; re-introduce the method-comparison table; harmonize speedup numbers; clarify BlackJAX vs emcee wording; drastically reduce overlays on slide 13; add one practical “getting started” code slide.\n- With these changes, the talk will match the abstract even more closely, run cleanly in 30–40 minutes for a mixed audience, and provide both conceptual foundation and actionable guidance.",

      "content": "Below is a detailed review of will_handley.tex, cross-checked against the source talks in context_prompt.md and aligned with the README abstract and the Birmingham audience/time constraints. Slide numbers refer to will_handley.tex (Title=slide 1; slides 2–10 pedagogy; 11–19 GPU/apps).\n\n1) Goal Achievement\n\n- GPU computing for classical statistical methods in astronomy\n  - Covered: Slides 11–13 set up GPU vs CPU, clarify the two distinct capabilities (AD vs GPU parallelization), and position BlackJAX as the GPU-native framework. Case studies (14–17) demonstrate practical GPU results in astronomy.\n  - Underemphasized: Practical “how-to” guidance for porting classical codes (e.g., minimal JAX/BlackJAX code, vectorization/JIT tips, common pitfalls like host-device transfers). No “get started” slide with install/links in the assembled talk.\n\n- Differentiable programming frameworks (JAX, PyTorch) for gradient-based and ensemble-based algorithms\n  - Covered: Slide 12 makes the key message explicit: AD and GPU parallelization are independent. JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Julia, Stan listed.\n  - Improvement: Slight confusion in slide 12’s left-column block where “Traditional Physics Benefits” includes nested sampling and vectorization (these are GPU parallelization wins, not AD per se). Consider tightening the mapping of bullets to the right capability (see Improvements).\n\n- BlackJAX framework applications with speedups (CMB/cosmic shear, GW)\n  - Covered: Slides 14–17 present four strong applications consistent with caltech_2025: CMB (300×), cosmic shear (days vs months), anomaly detection for SNe, and GW (20–40×).\n  - Gap vs README: README claims “300× for CMB/cosmic shear,” but your own ini_2025 shows cosmic shear >1000× vs CPU and ~10× vs a GPU NUTS approach. The slide currently avoids a number for cosmic shear (“Days vs months”). You should harmonize these numbers across README and slides.\n\n- AI coding assistants for modernizing scientific software development\n  - Covered: Slide 18 presents the “real AI revolution” as code development acceleration. Clear message, but abstract promises more concrete illustration. One short, tangible code-port example would help credibility.\n\n- Case studies combining classical algorithms, GPU hardware, and AI-assisted development\n  - Covered: Case studies (slides 14–17) plus the AI slide (18) and the conclusion (19) fulfill this goal.\n\nOverall: ~85% of the abstract’s aims are met. Strong on pedagogy and GPU results; lighter on practical migration guidance and harmonized speedup messaging.\n\n2) Accuracy Check (transfer vs source)\n\n- Pedagogical slides (2–10) vs sed_2025.tex:\n  - Slide 2 (goal) is generalized from SED fitting to astronomy; accurate and appropriate.\n  - Slides 3–10 track sed_2025 slides 2–9 almost verbatim: Bayesian identity, optimization, sampling rationale, MCMC, ensemble (emcee), evidence rationale, nested sampling mechanics, and counting trick. Copied correctly.\n  - Omitted from sed_2025:\n    - Practical Guidance (rejection vs chain-based; resolution/reliability params) – sed_2025 slide 10.\n    - Choosing Your Tool summary table – sed_2025 slide 11.\n  - These two omissions reduce the “what to choose and why” guidance that is helpful for a mixed audience.\n\n- GPU/software and applications (11–19) vs caltech_2025.tex:\n  - Slide 11 (GPU computing), slide 12 (two capabilities), and slide 13 (BlackJAX with 44 overlays) match caltech_2025 content.\n  - Case studies slides 14–17 match caltech_2025, including arXiv IDs and figures.\n  - AI slide (18): same message as caltech_2025; consistent.\n  - Conclusions (19): based on caltech_2025, with an added first bullet on statistical foundations.\n\n- Possible inconsistencies/risks:\n  - Slide 13 framesubtitles include “emcee: adaptive ensemble algorithms” alongside “All algorithms GPU-accelerated.” This could be read as BlackJAX implementing emcee’s affine-invariant sampler; BlackJAX provides HMC/NUTS/Metropolis/SMC and now NS, but not emcee per se. Clarify (see Improvements).\n  - Figure extensions: Early slides explicitly reference .pdf (e.g., himmelblau_* .pdf), while slide 13 uses extensionless names (e.g., himmelblau_mcmc). This is fine if both asset types exist or if extensionless lookup finds the correct files; otherwise, it can break the build. Unify usage or ensure all assets exist in both forms.\n\n3) Pedagogical Flow\n\n- Flow is coherent for Masters→faculty:\n  - Optimization → MCMC → Ensemble → Why evidence → Nested sampling mechanics → GPU/AD vs parallelization → BlackJAX landscape → Case studies → AI → Conclusions.\n  - Visuals are consistent (Himmelblau series), helping continuity.\n- One missing bridge:\n  - After slide 10, add a one-slide bridge mapping algorithmic structure to GPU parallel patterns (parallel chains, live points, particles; vectorized likelihoods; JIT; device RNG; where gradients matter vs not). This smooths the jump from algorithms to hardware.\n\n4) Content Balance\n\n- Current balance is roughly 50/50 (pedagogy 2–10; GPU/apps 11–19).\n- For 30–40 minutes, 19 slides with slide 13 having 44 overlays is risky for timing.\n- Recommendation:\n  - Keep a 40/60 balance (pedagogy/apps) by compressing overlays and adding one “how-to get started” slide instead of adding many new pedagogy slides.\n  - Pedagogy target: ~12–14 minutes. GPU overview + BlackJAX: ~6–8 minutes. Case studies: ~10–12 minutes. AI: ~2–3 minutes. Conclusions: ~1–2 minutes.\n\n5) Technical Accuracy\n\n- Bayesian/evidence identities are correct. The Occam identity log Z = E_p[log L] − D_KL(p||π) is sound.\n\n- Nested sampling volume contraction (slides 10):\n  - The counting-trick intuition V_{i+1} = V_i × n_inside/n_total is a pedagogical aid. The rigorous result is that the shrinkage t_i ~ Beta(n_live, 1) with E[log t] = −1/n_live and Var(log t) = 1/n_live; independent of dimension/geometry. Consider adding this as a short footnote or aside for the expert audience.\n\n- Algorithm descriptions are reasonable at the talk’s level. Ensemble samplers can struggle with separated modes; nested sampling is strong for multimodality and evidence.\n\n- GPU claims:\n  - “GPU memory bandwidth ~10× faster than CPU” is a fair rule of thumb but hardware-dependent. It’s fine in a talk; just avoid universal phrasing.\n  - “GPU ≠ ML; AD vs parallelization are independent”: correct and valuable.\n\n- Speedups:\n  - CMB: 300× vs CPU PolyChord is consistent with ini_2025 and caltech_2025.\n  - Cosmic shear: ini_2025 claims >1000× vs CPU and ~10× vs a prior GPU NUTS approach. Slide 14 currently says “Days vs months.” Harmonize numbers and cite arXiv.\n  - GW: 20–40× matches caltech_2025.\n\n- BlackJAX scope:\n  - As noted, avoid implying BlackJAX implements emcee. Phrase carefully.\n\n6) Improvements\n\na) Slide content and messaging\n\n- Add “Choosing Your Tool” summary (from sed_2025 slide 11)\n  - Place after slide 10. This single table slide helps the mixed audience pick methods and closes the pedagogy section cleanly.\n\n- Re-introduce “Practical Guidance” (sed_2025 slide 10 or bristol_2025 “Types of nested sampler”)\n  - One compressed slide: rejection vs chain-based kernels; resolution n_live; reliability params (e.g., eff, n_repeats, slices) and their role. This will answer common practitioner questions.\n\n- Insert a bridge slide after slide 10: “Where do GPUs help in inference?”\n  - Bullets:\n    - Parallel chains/particles/live points (MCMC/SMC/NS)\n    - Vectorize likelihoods across batches\n    - JIT compile + avoid host-device ping-pong\n    - Gradients help HMC/NUTS; not required for NS/ensemble\n    - Device RNG and reproducibility notes\n  - Keeps the cognitive thread from algorithms to hardware.\n\n- Tighten slide 12 (Two Capabilities)\n  - Align bullets under the right capability:\n    - Left (AD): gradients for HMC/NUTS; optimization.\n    - Right (GPU parallelization): nested sampling/SMC vectorization; likelihood batching; independent chains.\n  - Consider renaming “Traditional Physics Benefits” to “Where GPUs shine without gradients.”\n\n- Clarify slide 13 (BlackJAX landscape)\n  - Change “All algorithms GPU-accelerated” to “All BlackJAX algorithms run on GPU; here we illustrate the algorithm landscape (incl. emcee family for context).”\n  - Add a parenthetical: “Affine-invariant ensemble (emcee) shown for comparison; BlackJAX provides HMC/NUTS/Metropolis/SMC and NS on GPU.”\n  - Reduce overlays drastically (e.g., show 2–3 key frames per algorithm family, or replace with a single composite image). The current 44 overlays will derail timing.\n\n- Harmonize speedup claims on slide 14 and README\n  - Suggested bullets:\n    - CMB (6 params): 300× vs CPU PolyChord (e.g., ~1 hour → ~12 s on A100).\n    - Cosmic Shear (37 params): >1000× vs CPU baseline; ~10× vs prior GPU NUTS (12 A100 GPUs → 1 A100 in 4.5 hours) [add arXiv 2405.12965 if relevant].\n  - Update README to “CMB ~300×; cosmic shear >1000× vs CPU (10× vs prior GPU)” to match your slides and ini_2025.\n\n- Add a “getting started” slide (borrow from bristol_2025)\n  - Installation (pip install git+https://github.com/handley-lab/blackjax)\n  - Link to nested sampling book (handley-lab.co.uk/nested-sampling-book)\n  - One 6–8 line BlackJAX snippet (e.g., init state, one step, vmap over live points), to make it actionable.\n\n- Optional rigor aside on slide 10 (for faculty)\n  - Footnote: shrinkage t_i ~ Beta(n_live,1); E[log t]=−1/n_live; Var(log t)=1/n_live. Emphasize independence from dimension/geometry.\n\n- Consider an “apples-to-apples” note (from ini_2025)\n  - Short block: GPU availability/cost in HPC queues; when wall-time vs cost matters.\n\n- Minor: Update date on title slide from “TBD 2025” to the Birmingham date.\n\nb) Transitions between sections\n\n- Add the bridge slide (post-10).\n- Before slide 13: a 1-sentence transition on slide 12 or a mini-title: “BlackJAX: a unifying framework for GPU-native inference” to signal the shift from concepts to a tool/ecosystem.\n\nc) Emphasis and time allocation\n\n- Suggested pacing:\n  - Slides 2–5: 5–6 min (intro, Bayesian identity, optimization, why samples)\n  - Slides 6–10: 7–8 min (MCMC, ensemble, evidence, NS mechanics, counting trick)\n  - Practical Guidance + Choosing Tool + Bridge: 3–4 min total\n  - Slides 11–12: 3–4 min (GPU, 2 capabilities)\n  - Slide 13 (BlackJAX): 3–4 min (only if overlays are reduced)\n  - Slides 14–17: 10–12 min (case studies)\n  - Slide 18 (AI): 2–3 min (one mini example)\n  - Slide 19 (Conclusions): 1–2 min\n  - Q&A: 3–5 min\n- Biggest risk: slide 13 overlays → compress.\n\nd) Additional material to include\n\n- Minimal BlackJAX code snippet (NS or HMC) + installation + docs/resources.\n- One concrete AI-assisted port example:\n  - e.g., “Translating a Fortran likelihood to JAX: 2 code lines before/after; what the agent did; runtime change.”\n- Short note on profiling (JIT compile overhead vs run; warmup times) and common pitfalls (data copying, PRNG, non-JIT-able Python in the likelihood).\n\ne) Material to condense or remove\n\n- Slide 13 overlays (cut by >60%; consider a static collage).\n- If pressed for time, compress “Why do sampling?” (slide 5) to retain only the golden rule f(E[X]) ≠ E[f(X)] and the “stay in samples” message.\n\nPotential build/wording fixes\n\n- Figure paths: unify extension usage (.pdf vs extensionless) across slides to avoid compilation issues.\n- Slide 13 wording to avoid implying BlackJAX implements emcee.\n- Slide 12: reassign bullets to the correct capability columns for clarity.\n- Align README speedup claims with slides (cosmic shear numbers).\n\nSummary\n\n- Strengths: Clear, accessible pedagogical buildup; excellent GPU case studies with credible speedups; crisp articulation of AD vs GPU parallelization; timely AI angle.\n- Main fixes: Re-add the practical guidance + summary table; add a GPU bridge slide; harmonize speedup numbers; clarify BlackJAX vs emcee; reduce slide 13 overlays; add a “getting started” code slide; tighten the “two capabilities” mapping.\n- With these revisions, the talk will better match the abstract, run comfortably in 30–40 minutes for a mixed audience, and offer both conceptual understanding and actionable steps for adoption.",
