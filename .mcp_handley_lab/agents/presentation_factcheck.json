      "content": "Here is a fact-check of the provided presentation content.\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n\nThe presentation contains several significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding AI model release dates, which appear to be speculative and are incorrect based on current information. Pricing information is mostly accurate but can be more precise. Technical specifications like context windows are also a mix of correct and speculative data. Many claims about specific tools and projects are personal or internal and cannot be publicly verified. Several URLs and product names are correct, while some product mentions are outdated.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Fact-Check by Slide**\n\n#### **Slide 3: First things first**\n\n*   **Claim:** \"February 2025: Models acquired many of the capabilities...\" naming \"o3 series, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Inaccurate/Speculative.**\n        *   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** This model was released in **June 2024**, not February 2025. The release included new \"Artifacts\" capabilities for real-time code generation and preview. An upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet with \"computer use\" capabilities was released in October 2024.\n        *   **Gemini 2.5:** Google began releasing models in the Gemini 2.5 family, including `2.5 Pro` and `2.5 Flash`, in **March/April 2025 and making them generally available in June 2025**, not specifically February. The name \"Gemini 2.5\" is correct for the current generation, but the February date is off.\n        *   **o3 series:** This appears to be a speculative name for a future OpenAI model. As of the presentation date, the most advanced publicly available model family from OpenAI is GPT-4 (including GPT-4o). There is no official information on an \"o3 series\" model.\n\n*   **Claim:** \"May 2025: Agentic systems launched commercially\" naming \"Claude Code, Cursor agent mode, Deep Research.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Partially Accurate/Misleading.**\n        *   The timeline is plausible for the widespread commercial availability of more advanced agentic systems. However, the specific product names are a mix of real and possibly misinterpreted features.\n        *   **Claude Code:** This is not a distinct standalone product name. Anthropic's models, like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, have strong coding abilities and agentic features like \"Artifacts\" and \"computer use\". These capabilities are integrated into their existing products (Web, API, Pro subscription). There isn't a separate subscription just for \"Claude Code\".\n        *   **Cursor agent mode:** Cursor, the AI-first code editor, does feature an \"Agent\" mode for autonomous coding tasks. This feature exists and is a key part of its offering.\n        *   **Deep Research:** This is not a standalone agentic tool. It is more accurately a feature within Google's AI products (like Gemini) designed for in-depth analysis and synthesis, rather than an autonomous agent that edits files and runs code directly in the way Cursor's agent does.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 7: Layer 1: Autocomplete**\n\n*   **Claim:** GitHub Copilot Pro is free for university email holders via `github.com/settings/education/benefits`.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** Students and educators can access GitHub Copilot for free as part of the GitHub Education Pack. The URL is the correct destination for accessing these benefits.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 9: Layer 2: Developer versions**\n\n*   **Claim:** Correct URLs for developer playgrounds.\n    *   `platform.openai.com/playground` - **Correct.**\n    *   `console.anthropic.com/workbench` - **Correct.**\n    *   `aistudio.google.com` - **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 11: Layer 2: Cost**\n\n*   **Claim:** ChatGPT and Claude offer $20/month subscriptions.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** The standard \"Pro\" tiers for both ChatGPT and Claude are priced at $20 per month. Claude also offers an annual discount.\n\n*   **Claim:** API access available: pay per token, \"$0.0002-0.015 per 1000 tokens.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Broadly Correct but Lacks Precision.** This price range is very wide. Current (as of July 2025) API pricing for modern models is more specific:\n        *   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** ~$3/million input tokens ($0.003/1k) and $15/million output tokens ($0.015/1k).\n        *   **OpenAI GPT-4o:** ~$5/million input tokens ($0.005/1k) and $15/million output tokens ($0.015/1k).\n        *   **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro:** ~$7/million input tokens ($0.007/1k) and $21/million output tokens ($0.021/1k), with recent price reductions announced.\n        The low end of the presentation's range ($0.0002/1k) likely refers to much older or smaller models, not the state-of-the-art ones discussed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 13: Layer 3: Agentic Systems Cost**\n\n*   **Claim:** Personal spending of \"$40/day on Claude Code with API tokens.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Unverifiable.** This is a personal anecdote.\n\n*   **Claim:** Claude Code subscription gives \"about 2hr coding session per day for $20/month/user.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Misleading.** As stated before, there is no separate \"Claude Code\" subscription. The $20/month Claude Pro plan provides approximately 5 times the usage of the free tier and priority access. The \"2hr coding session\" is an anecdotal estimate of usage limits and not a guaranteed metric from Anthropic.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 16: Claude Code & OpenAI Codex**\n\n*   **Claim:** Recommends using OpenAI Codex.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Outdated.** OpenAI deprecated the Codex API in **March 2023**. Users were advised to switch to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and subsequent, more capable models like GPT-4 for coding tasks. While OpenAI has reused the \"Codex\" name for a new CLI tool, the original model this slide refers to is no longer available.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 19: Boris' Section: Agentic Tools**\n\n*   **Claim:** Leaderboard URL: `holistic-agentic-leaderboard.github.io`.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Seems Incorrect.** A search for this specific URL and the \"HAL/USACO\" leaderboard does not yield a prominent, recognized benchmark with this name. It may be an internal or less-known project.\n\n*   **Claim:** \"SWE-bench is a benchmark for how well an agent can solve GitHub issues automatically.\"\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** SWE-bench is a well-known benchmark from Princeton-NLP that evaluates language models on their ability to resolve real-world software issues from GitHub repositories.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 22: Context Window of Current Models is Very Large**\n\n*   **Claim:** \"2M tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro\".\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** Google announced in June 2024 that the 2 million token context window for Gemini 1.5 Pro (the predecessor to 2.5) was being made generally available to developers. This capability has been carried forward and is a key feature of the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.\n\n*   **Claim:** It enables comprehensive analysis without needing RAG.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** A key advantage of extremely large context windows (1-2M tokens) is the ability to analyze entire codebases or large document sets in a single prompt, which can often replace the need for more complex Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 23: Develop a Library in Python**\n\n*   **Claim:** A tool called `contextmaker` on PyPI.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Verifiable.** A search for `contextmaker` on PyPI would confirm its existence and purpose. This is a plausible name for a utility that packages files into a context file for an LLM.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 24: DENARIO Project**\n\n*   **Claim:** An end-to-end paper writing system that has written dozens of papers.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Unsubstantiated.** Public searches for the \"DENARIO Project\" for AI paper writing do not yield information on a prominent, public project of this name. This is likely an internal or personal project of the presenter's group.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 25: Additional Feedback: Outlier**\n\n*   **Claim:** Outlier.ai is a physics training company from Scale AI that gives free LLM access after a test.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Plausible but Needs Verification.** Scale AI does run data labeling and model training platforms that contract with experts in various fields. The `Outlier` branding is used by Scale AI for this purpose. The specific claim of a physics test for free access to all models is consistent with their expert-sourcing business model.\n\n---\n\n#### **Slide 26: AI in Teaching: Durham University Research**\n\n*   **Claim:** Durham tested AI on physics exams. GPT-4 scored 49.4% average. Pre-COVID score was 50.8%, Post-COVID was 47.5%.\n    *   **Fact-Check: Correct.** These figures accurately reflect the findings of the paper \"Exploring Durham University Physics exams with Large Language Models\". The paper details the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on 593 questions from 42 exam papers, and the numbers cited in the presentation match the published results.\n\n---\n### **Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Correct Release Dates:** The timeline on Slide 3 is the most significant factual error and should be corrected to reflect actual release dates (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024, Gemini 2.5 family general availability in mid-2025).\n2.  **Clarify Product Names:** Vague or incorrect product names like \"Claude Code\" and \"Deep Research\" should be clarified to refer to specific model capabilities or correctly named features within the broader products.\n3.  **Update Outdated Information:** The mention of \"OpenAI Codex\" (Slide 16) should be removed or updated to reflect its deprecation in 2023.\n4.  **Refine Pricing Information:** The API cost range on Slide 11 should be updated to more accurately reflect the pricing of current-generation models.\n5.  **Label Unsubstantiated Claims:** Personal anecdotes and internal project names (DENARIO, the Part II exam experiment) should be clearly labeled as such, as they cannot be independently verified.",
