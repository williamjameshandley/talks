      "content": "Excellent question! Seeing \"Prospector\" and \"pop-cosmos\" on a workshop schedule is a clear sign that the focus is on the cutting-edge of galaxy evolution studies. You've correctly identified that they are related to Bayesian SED fitting, but they represent two different, albeit connected, rungs on the ladder of galaxy modeling.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what they are and how they relate to each other.\n\n---\n\n### Prospector: The Bayesian Engine for Individual Galaxies\n\nIn short, **Prospector is a state-of-the-art software package and modeling framework for fitting the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and/or spectra of individual galaxies.**\n\n**1. What it is:**\n*   **Software Package:** It's a powerful, flexible, open-source code written in Python.\n*   **Modeling Framework:** It provides the tools to build complex, physically motivated models of galaxies. Unlike older codes that might have a fixed set of models, Prospector allows the user to combine different physical components (star formation history, dust attenuation, nebular emission, etc.) in a modular way.\n*   **Methodology:** Its core philosophy is **Bayesian Inference**.\n\n**2. Key Features and Why It's Important:**\n\n*   **Bayesian Approach:** Instead of finding a single \"best-fit\" model (a chi-squared minimization), Prospector explores the entire parameter space to generate a **posterior probability distribution** for every parameter. This gives you not just the most likely value for, say, stellar mass, but also its uncertainty and its covariance with all other model parameters (e.g., how the uncertainty in dust affects the uncertainty in stellar mass). This is typically done using advanced sampling algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Nested Sampling.\n*   **Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS):** It is built on top of the FSPS (Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis) code by Charlie Conroy. This gives it access to a wide range of stellar evolution tracks, initial mass functions (IMFs), and spectral libraries.\n*   **Non-parametric Star Formation Histories (SFHs):** This is a major innovation. Instead of assuming a simple, smooth functional form for the SFH (like an exponential decay), Prospector can model it as a series of independent star formation rates in different time bins. This allows it to reconstruct much more complex and realistic \"bursty\" or \"quenching\" histories for individual galaxies.\n*   **Combined Photometry and Spectroscopy:** It can simultaneously fit broadband photometric data (the SED) and spectroscopic data. This is incredibly powerful, as the spectra provide much more detailed constraints on things like metallicity, velocity dispersion, and recent star formation.\n\n**In essence, Prospector is the tool you use when you want to perform a highly detailed, physically rich, and statistically robust analysis of a *single galaxy*.**\n\n---\n\n### pop-cosmos: The Hierarchical Framework for Galaxy Populations\n\n**pop-cosmos is a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework built *on top of* Prospector to study entire populations of galaxies simultaneously.**\n\n**1. What it is:**\n*   **Not a standalone SED fitter:** It uses Prospector as its engine to handle the modeling of individual galaxies.\n*   **Methodology:** Its key concept is **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**. This is a statistical method for analyzing data that exists on multiple levels.\n\n**2. How it Works and Why It's a Game-Changer:**\n\nImagine you have a sample of 1,000 galaxies from a survey.\n\n*   **The Old Way:** You could run Prospector on each of the 1,000 galaxies individually. You would get 1,000 posterior distributions for stellar mass, star formation rate, etc. Then, you could plot all the best-fit values (e.g., SFR vs. Stellar Mass) and fit a line to them to find the \"star-forming main sequence.\" This is a two-step process that can introduce biases and doesn't properly propagate uncertainties.\n\n*   **The pop-cosmos Way (Hierarchical Modeling):** With pop-cosmos, you define a model for the *population* itself. For example, you might hypothesize that all your galaxies lie on a star-forming main sequence that is a power-law with some intrinsic scatter.\n\n    The pop-cosmos model then fits for everything *at once*:\n    1.  **Hyper-parameters:** The parameters that describe the population trend (e.g., the slope, normalization, and scatter of the main sequence).\n    2.  **Individual Galaxy Parameters:** The specific properties of each galaxy (its true stellar mass, SFR, dust content, etc.).\n\nIn this framework, the individual galaxy properties are assumed to be drawn from the population-level distribution defined by the hyper-parameters.\n\n**3. Key Advantages:**\n\n*   **Direct Inference of Population Properties:** You directly obtain the posterior distribution for the population-level parameters (e.g., \"the slope of the main sequence is $0.8 \\pm 0.05$\"). This is the primary scientific goal.\n*   **Improved Individual Constraints:** Information from the population helps constrain the properties of individual galaxies. A faint galaxy with poor data, which would have very large uncertainties when fit alone, is \"informed\" by the fact that it likely belongs to the main sequence. Its final posterior is a compromise between its own data and the population trend, leading to more reasonable estimates.\n*   **Statistically Robust:** It self-consistently handles selection effects, measurement errors, and intrinsic population scatter, avoiding many of the biases inherent in two-step fitting procedures.\n\n---\n\n### Analogy and Summary\n\n| Feature                 | Prospector                                                                   | pop-cosmos                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Primary Target**      | A single galaxy                                                              | An entire population or sample of galaxies                                                              |\n| **Methodology**         | Bayesian Inference                                                           | **Hierarchical** Bayesian Inference                                                                     |\n| **Key Output**          | Posterior distributions for one galaxy's physical properties (mass, SFH, etc.) | Posterior distributions for **population-level trends** (e.g., main sequence slope) and individual properties. |\n| **Relationship**        | The engine that models the physics of a galaxy.                              | The framework that uses Prospector to model a population, linking individual galaxies through a shared model. |\n| **Workshop Talk Title** | \"Reconstructing the Star Formation History of Galaxy X with Prospector\"        | \"The Star Formation Properties of Galaxy Populations with pop-cosmos\" (exactly as you saw!)              |\n\n**Analogy:** Imagine measuring the height of students in a classroom.\n\n*   **Prospector** is like using a very precise laser tool to measure a *single student's* height, giving you a measurement and a well-defined error bar.\n*   **pop-cosmos** is like measuring the *entire class* at once with the assumption that their heights follow a Gaussian distribution.

      "content": "You've picked up on a key distinction in modern astronomical data analysis. \"Prospector\" and \"pop-cosmos\" are indeed related to SED fitting, but they operate at different levels of the modeling process. Here’s a breakdown of what they are and how they connect:\n\n### Prospector: A Tool for Individual Galaxies\n\n**Prospector** is a powerful and flexible software package and modeling framework designed to infer the physical properties of **individual galaxies** from their spectra and/or photometry.\n\nHere are its key features:\n\n*   **Software and Framework:** It's a Python-based code that provides the structure to build complex galaxy models. It uses other foundational tools like `FSPS` (Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis) to generate the spectra of stellar populations.\n*   **Bayesian Methodology:** At its core, Prospector uses Bayesian inference. Instead of finding a single \"best-fit\" model, it explores the full range of possible parameters using methods like Monte Carlo sampling. This approach provides robust estimates of uncertainties and reveals degeneracies between different physical parameters (like age, metallicity, and dust).\n*   **Flexibility:** A major strength of Prospector is its flexibility. It can model highly complex and non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs), a flexible dust attenuation law, and nebular emission lines. This allows it to reconstruct more realistic and \"bursty\" galaxy histories compared to simpler models.\n*   **Combined Data:** It is designed to rigorously combine different types of data, such as broad-band photometry (the SED) and high-resolution spectroscopy, in a single fit.\n\nIn short, Prospector is the engine you would use to perform a detailed, state-of-the-art analysis of a single galaxy's light to understand its stellar mass, star formation history, dust content, and other physical properties.\n\n### pop-cosmos: A Model for the Entire Galaxy Population\n\n**pop-cosmos** is a comprehensive modeling framework built upon Prospector to describe and characterize an **entire population of galaxies** at once.\n\nHere’s how it works and why it's different:\n\n*   **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling:** The key concept behind pop-cosmos is *hierarchical Bayesian modeling*. Instead of fitting each galaxy in a large survey one-by-one, this method models the individual galaxies and the population-level trends simultaneously.\n*   **Forward Modeling Approach:** It builds a detailed \"forward model\" of a galaxy survey. This includes a model for the distribution of galaxy properties (like mass and star formation rate) across cosmic time, the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis (SPS) model to turn those properties into observable light (using Prospector as a foundation), and a model for the observational process itself (noise, selection effects, etc.).\n*   **Population-Level Inference:** The primary goal of pop-cosmos is to infer the parameters that describe the galaxy population as a whole. For example, it can directly measure the star-forming main sequence (the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate) and how it evolves with redshift, complete with robust uncertainties.\n*   **Improved Individual Properties:** A powerful side-effect of this approach is that the population model acts as a physically motivated \"prior\" when estimating the properties of any single galaxy. This means that information from the entire population helps to better constrain the properties of individual galaxies, especially those with faint or limited data.\n\nA talk titled \"The Star Formation Properties of Galaxy Populations with pop-cosmos\" is therefore about using this hierarchical framework to study large-scale trends in how galaxies form stars across cosmic history, using data from a large survey like COSMOS.\n\n### The Relationship: Engine and Framework\n\nThink of the relationship this way:\n\n> **Prospector is the engine that models the complex physics of a single galaxy. pop-cosmos is the sophisticated framework that uses this engine to model an entire fleet of galaxies, learning about both the fleet's overall characteristics and the performance of each individual engine within it.**\n\nIn practice, pop-cosmos uses the principles and models from Prospector (often in the form of fast neural network \"emulators\" of the full SPS calculations) to connect the underlying physical properties of galaxies to their observable SEDs. This allows it to perform its population-level inference on the massive datasets from modern galaxy surveys.",

      "content": "This is an excellent and very well-thought-out talk plan. You have a clear narrative, a logical progression, and a keen sense of your audience's needs. The pedagogical approach is spot-on for this context.\n\nHere is a detailed evaluation based on your five points:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Structure and Flow - Does the progression make sense?\n\n**Evaluation: Excellent.**\n\nThe structure is a model of how to build a pedagogical technical talk. It follows a natural and compelling progression:\n\n1.  **The Problem:** What is SED fitting from a statistical perspective? (Slide 1)\n2.  **The Language:** What is the common framework we use to talk about it? (Bayes, Slide 2)\n3.  **The Simplest Solution:** What's the \"obvious\" but limited approach? (χ², Slide 3)\n4.  **The Better Way:** Why do we need something more complex? (Sampling vs. Optimization, Slide 4)\n5.  **The Workhorses:** How do the main sampling methods work? (MCMC -> Ensemble -> Nested, Slides 5-7)\n6.  **The Decision:** How do I choose the right tool for my problem? (Comparison, Slide 8)\n7.  **The Future & Conclusion:** What's next? (Slides 9-10)\n\nThis flow effectively builds a foundation of understanding step-by-step. Each slide's limitations directly motivate the topic of the next slide, which is a hallmark of great teaching. The transition from MCMC's limitations (getting stuck) to Ensemble's improvement (better mixing) to Nested's advantages (multimodality, evidence) is particularly strong.\n\n### 2. Timing Allocation - Is 25 minutes realistic for this content?\n\n**Evaluation: Ambitious but feasible, with one major risk.**\n\nThe timing is tight. You have allocated roughly 2-3 minutes per core concept, which requires discipline.\n\n*   **Realistic Parts:** Slides 1-4 are straightforward and the timing is likely fine.\n*   **Pressure Point:** **Slide 7 (Nested Sampling)** is the most challenging. Explaining nested sampling conceptually in 5 minutes is very difficult. The \"shrinking volume\" analogy is standard but can be hard for people to grasp intuitively. You may need to simplify aggressively or risk going over time and losing the audience.\n*   **The \"Cuttable\" Slide:** **Slide 9 (AI in Scientific Code Development)** is a great topic, but it feels like an add-on to the core statistical narrative. If you are running short on time, this is the first and easiest slide to drop entirely. Its content isn't essential for understanding the follow-up talks on nested sampling or hierarchical modeling.\n\n**Recommendation:** Rehearse the talk with a timer, focusing especially on Slide 7. Be prepared to sacrifice Slide 9 to ensure you can land the core statistical concepts without rushing. You could potentially trim 1 minute each from Slides 3 (χ²) and 5 (MCMC) to give yourself more breathing room on Slide 7.\n\n### 3. Content Depth - Appropriate level for the audience?\n\n**Evaluation: Perfect.**\n\nYou have gauged the audience's needs precisely. They are practitioners, not statisticians. They know the *names* of the tools but need the *intuition* behind them.\n\n*   You correctly avoid equations and theorems.\n*   You focus on the \"how it works\" conceptually (e.g., \"hill climbing,\" \"walkers,\" \"shrinking volume\").\n*   You connect the methods to their practical advantages and limitations (speed vs. robustness, point estimate vs. full posterior).\n*   Referencing tools they know (`emcee`, `dynesty`) without getting bogged down in implementation details is exactly the right approach.\n\n### 4. Missing Elements - Anything important left out?\n\n**Evaluation: One key element is missing given the workshop context.**\n\nThe plan excellently sets up David Yallup's talk on GPU-accelerated **nested sampling**. However, the prompt mentions the audience is also familiar with **pop-cosmos**, which implies a focus on **hierarchical modeling**. Your talk plan does not currently bridge to this topic.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nAdd a slide or modify an existing one to introduce the concept of **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**. This is the statistical foundation of `pop-cosmos`.\n\n**Option A: A New Slide (between 8 and 9)**\n\n*   **Title:** \"From Single Galaxies to Populations: Hierarchical Modeling\" (2-3 mins)\n*   **Purpose:** Bridge from single-object fitting to population studies (`pop-cosmos`).\n*   **Content:**\n    *   **The Problem:** We've learned how to fit one galaxy. What if we have 10,000? Fitting them individually and then fitting the results is statistically biased.\n    *   **The Idea:** A hierarchical model fits everything at once. It has parameters for individual galaxies (like Prospector) *and* \"hyper-parameters\" that describe the population they are drawn from (e.g., the slope and scatter of the star-forming main sequence).\n    *   **Analogy:** It's like measuring the properties of a single student vs. simultaneously measuring all students to find the class average and standard deviation. The class-level information helps you get a better measurement for each individual student, and vice-versa.\n*   **Key Message:** Hierarchical modeling lets us robustly infer population-level trends by connecting individual fits in a single, self-consistent model. This is the magic behind `pop-cosmos`.\n\nThis addition would make your intro talk a complete foundation for *all* the advanced topics that follow, not just the nested sampling one. To make time, you would almost certainly need to cut the AI slide.\n\n### 5. Pedagogical Approach - Effective for explaining statistical concepts?\n\n**Evaluation: Excellent.**\n\nYour approach is highly effective and well-suited for the audience.\n\n*   **Visuals are Key:** Your plan to rely heavily on visuals and parameter space diagrams is the right one. For nested sampling, an animation of the shrinking contours is far more powerful than words.\n*   **Analogies Work:** \"Hill climbing,\" \"random walkers,\" and \"shrinking volume\" are great conceptual anchors.\n*   **Framing is Crucial:** Framing everything within the SED fitting context keeps it relevant. Using the age-metallicity-dust degeneracy as a recurring example of a \"hard problem\" that different methods solve better or worse would be very effective.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Recommendations\n\nThis is a strong, well-designed plan that will serve the workshop participants well.\n\n1.  **Keep the Flow:** The overall structure is perfect.\n2.  **Watch the Clock:** The timing is tight. Practice and be ready to cut Slide 9 (AI). Consider trimming time from simpler concepts (χ², MCMC) to give to Slide 7 (Nested Sampling).\n3.  **Add the Missing Link:** **Crucially, add a brief introduction to Hierarchical Modeling.** This provides the necessary foundation for the `pop-cosmos` context and makes your talk a more complete introduction to the workshop's themes.\n4.  **Execute the Pedagogy:** Lean into the visual, analogy-driven approach. It's the right call for this audience.\n\nBy incorporating the hierarchical modeling concept, this will transition from a very good talk plan to an outstanding one that perfectly sets the stage for the entire workshop.",

      "content": "Of course. I have reviewed the changes across all seven scripts.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n**Yes, your changes are mathematically correct and consistent across all scripts.** You have successfully refactored the code to use `beta` as a standard inverse temperature parameter where the log-probability is directly proportional to `-beta * Himmelblau`.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the changes are correct.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Correct Interpretation of `beta` as Inverse Temperature\n\nYour goal was to make `beta` an inverse temperature parameter, where the probability is given by $P \\propto e^{-\\beta E}$. In our case, the \"energy\" $E$ is the Himmelblau function, and the log-probability (or log-likelihood) is:\n\n$$ \\text{logprob} = -\\beta \\times \\text{Himmelblau}(\\text{position}) $$\n\nYour change to implement this as `return -himmelblau(x, y) * beta` in all the `logprob` and `loglikelihood` functions is **perfectly correct**.\n\n### 2. Consistency of the `beta` Value Change\n\nYou changed `beta = 100` to `beta = 0.1` and simultaneously changed the scaling factor from `... / (beta * 0.1)` to `... * beta`. Let's check the math:\n\n*   **Old Code:** `beta = 100`. The scaling was `1 / (beta * 0.1)` = `1 / (100 * 0.1)` = `1 / 10` = `0.1`.\n*   **New Code:** `beta = 0.1`. The scaling is now just `beta` = `0.1`.\n\nThe effective scaling factor applied to `-himmelblau(x, y)` is **identical** (`0.1`) in both the old and new versions. You have correctly refactored the code to be cleaner and more intuitive, removing the confusing extra multiplication.\n\n### 3. Correctness of the Nested Sampling Threshold Calculation\n\nThis is the most critical consistency check, and you've nailed it.\n\n*   The relationship is: `logL = -himmelblau * beta`\n*   To find the Himmelblau contour value (`himmelblau`) that corresponds to a given log-likelihood threshold (`logL`), you must invert the equation:\n    $$ \\text{himmelblau} = -\\frac{\\text{logL}}{\\beta} $$\n*   Your new code in `himmelblau_ns.py` and `himmelblau_ns_counting_trick.py` implements exactly this:\n    `all_threshold_vals = [-logL / beta for logL in all_dead_logL]`\n\nThis is the correct inverse transformation for your new `loglikelihood` function.\n\n---\n\n### A Note on the Physical Meaning of `beta`\n\nThere is one minor point of confusion in your prompt that is worth clarifying, even though your code is correct:\n\n> \"beta = 0.1 means low temperature/high concentration\"\n\nThis is reversed. In the standard `beta = 1/kT` convention:\n*   **High `beta`** (e.g., 100) means **low temperature**, which leads to **high concentration** (the probability distribution is sharply peaked at the minima of the Himmelblau function).\n*   **Low `beta`** (e.g., 0.1) means **high temperature**, which leads to **low concentration** (the probability distribution is broad, \"washed out,\" and easier to sample).\n\nYour change from an effective `beta` of 100 (in the old logic) to `beta = 0.1` was likely done to make the function's peaks broader and the visualization of samplers more effective, which is a great idea. Your code correctly implements a **high-temperature** (low `beta`) system.\n\n---\n\n### File-by-File Confirmation\n\n*   `himmelblau_gradient_ascent.py`: **Correct.** `logprob` uses `* beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_samples.py`: **Correct.** `logprob` uses `* beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_mcmc.py`: **Correct.** `logprob` uses `* beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_emcee.py`: **Correct.** `logprob` uses `* beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_hmc.py`: **Correct.** `logprob` uses `* beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_ns.py`: **Correct.** `loglikelihood` uses `* beta` and the threshold calculation correctly uses `/ beta`.\n*   `himmelblau_ns_counting_trick.py`: **Correct.** `loglikelihood` uses `* beta` and the threshold calculation correctly uses `/ beta`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The changes are excellent. They make the code more readable, align it with standard statistical mechanics conventions, and are implemented consistently and correctly across all scripts. You are good to go.",

After reviewing the scripts, I can confirm that **the current implementation is not only correct but also the most pedagogically effective approach.**\n\nHere's a detailed assessment and the reasoning behind it.\n\n---\n\n### Assessment Summary\n\nThe user's concern about \"unnecessary conversion\" is understandable from a pure code-reduction perspective, but it misses the crucial distinction between the *sampling space* and the *visualization space*.\n\n*   **Sampling Space:** The algorithms (MCMC, Nested Sampling) operate in **log-likelihood space**. This is where probabilities are multiplied by adding their logs, which is numerically stable and mathematically natural for these algorithms.\n*   **Visualization Space:** Humans are more intuitive at understanding the original function's landscape—in this case, the **Himmelblau function space**. We easily see the \"valleys\" and \"hills.\" Plotting contours of log-likelihood would be confusing, as the values would be negative and inverted (minima become maxima).\n\nTherefore, the scripts are correctly performing a necessary conversion for a specific purpose: **to translate the results from the algorithm's natural space into a human's intuitive space for visualization.**\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n### a) Work entirely in log-likelihood space?\n\n*   **Mathematical Correctness:** This would be correct from the algorithm's point of view.\n*   **Code Clarity & Pedagogy:** This would be a very poor choice for visualization.\n    *   The Himmelblau function has four distinct minima around `Z=0`.\n    *   In log-likelihood space (`logL = -0.1 * Z`), these minima become four maxima around `logL=0`.\n    *   The contours would be labeled with negative numbers, and the \"valleys\" we want to see would be \"peaks\" in the data. This is counter-intuitive and would make the plots much harder to interpret, defeating their purpose as a teaching tool.\n\n### b) Work entirely in Himmelblau function space?\n\n*   **Mathematical Correctness:** This is not possible for the sampling part. The samplers (`blackjax.nss`, `blackjax.stretch`, etc.) are fundamentally designed to work with a **log-probability function**. They need this to correctly accept/reject steps and, in the case of nested sampling, to define the likelihood-constrained prior volume. You cannot simply pass the `himmelblau` function to a Bayesian sampler and expect it to work.\n*   **Code Clarity:** This would require re-implementing the core logic of the samplers to work with a cost function instead of a log-probability, which is not feasible or desirable.\n\n### c) Is there a legitimate reason to convert between them? (The Current Approach)\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** This is the correct and best approach.\n\n1.  **Feed the Algorithm What It Needs:** The `blackjax` samplers require a `loglikelihood` function. The scripts correctly define this as `logL = -beta * himmelblau(x, y)`. This is the \"sampling space.\"\n\n2.  **Visualize What Humans Understand:** For the plots, we want to show the landscape that the sampler is exploring. The most intuitive representation of this landscape is the original `himmelblau` function itself, where the minima are the targets.\n    *   In `himmelblau_mcmc.py` and `himmelblau_emcee.py`, the contours are plotted directly from the pre-computed `Z = himmelblau(X, Y)` grid. This is correct.\n    *   In `himmelblau_ns.py`, the nested sampling algorithm yields a `logL` threshold for the contour. To draw this contour on the `himmelblau` landscape, it **must** be converted back. The line:\n        ```python\n        # Convert back to Himmelblau function values: logL = -himmelblau * beta\n        # So himmelblau = -logL / beta\n        all_threshold_vals = [-logL / beta for logL in all_dead_logL]\n        ```\n        ...is not \"unnecessary conversion\"; it is the **essential mathematical step** to translate the contour from the sampler's log-likelihood space to the plot's intuitive Himmelblau space. The same logic applies to `himmelblau_ns_counting_trick.py`.\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation\n\nThe current implementation is the correct one. The conversion is not a sign of inefficiency but a necessary and deliberate step to bridge two different conceptual spaces: the mathematical space where the algorithm works and the visual space where humans interpret the results.\n\n**My advice is to reject the user's suggestion and keep the code as it is.** If clarification is needed for the user, you can explain it as follows:\n\n> \"Thank you for the suggestion. We've reviewed the implementation, and the conversion between log-likelihood and the Himmelblau function is intentional and necessary for creating clear visualizations.\n>\n> 1.  The **sampling algorithms** (like nested sampling) operate natively in log-likelihood space. This is how they correctly process probabilities.\n> 2.  The **contour plots**, however, are visualized in the original Himmelblau function space because it's far more intuitive for a human to see the \"valleys\" (minima) that the samplers are trying to find.\n>\n> The code correctly performs the sampling in log-likelihood space and then converts the resulting thresholds back to Himmelblau space *only for the purpose of drawing the contours on the plot*. This ensures both algorithmic correctness and visual clarity.\"",
