      "content": "### Durham University AI Physics Exam Study: A Fact-Check\n\nA recent study by Durham University researchers, titled \"Exploring Durham University Physics exams with Large Language Models,\" has been largely verified for its key claims regarding the performance of AI models on university-level physics assessments. The research provides a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and limitations of current AI in a real-world academic setting.\n\nThe study's core findings have been confirmed as follows:\n\n*   **Comprehensive Test Data:** The research was based on a substantial dataset comprising 42 exam papers from 10 different physics courses administered at Durham University between 2018 and 2022. This dataset included a total of 593 questions, amounting to 2504 available marks.\n\n*   **AI Performance Scores:** The reported average scores for the AI models are accurate. GPT-4 achieved an average score of 49.4%, while GPT-3.5 scored 38.6%.\n\n*   **Impact on Student Performance:** The paper suggests that, based on these scores, only weaker students would likely see an improvement in their marks by using AI. This indicates that the current AI models do not consistently outperform the majority of students.\n\n*   **Post-COVID Exam Performance:** The study found a slight decrease in AI performance on exams from the post-COVID era (2021-2022), which were often open-book and featured less fact-based questions. In this subset of exams, GPT-4's average score dropped to 47.5%, and GPT-3.5's to 33.6%.\n\n*   **Current AI Limitations:** The findings support the conclusion that current AI models face significant challenges with university-level physics questions, highlighting their limitations in the context of advanced academic assessment. The research paper itself states, \"These findings suggest that while current AI models struggle with university-level Physics questions, an improving trend is observable.\"\n\n*   **Paper Title:** The title of the research paper is correctly identified as \"Exploring Durham University Physics exams with Large Language Models\".\n\nOne claim made in the provided content could not be substantiated by the research paper:\n\n*   **Formatting and Old Languages:** The search for information within the study about the AI's performance on \"formatting languages or other old languages\" yielded no results. The research focuses specifically on physics problems and does not appear to evaluate the AI's capabilities in these other areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of the claims regarding the Durham University AI physics exam study are factually accurate and well-supported by the published research. The study provides valuable insights into the current state of AI in academic physics, demonstrating its potential as a tool while also emphasizing its present-day limitations.",

      "content": "A fact-check of the provided content about Durham University's AI research reveals that most of the claims are accurate and well-supported by the research paper titled, \"Exploring Durham University Physics exams with Large Language Models.\" However, one claim is unsubstantiated.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the verified claims:\n\n*   **Dataset Scope:** The study did test AI on a significant portion of their physics exam dataset. The research utilized 42 exam papers from 10 distinct physics courses spanning from 2018 to 2022. This dataset comprised 593 questions, with a total of 2504 available marks.\n\n*   **AI Performance Scores:** The reported average scores are correct. GPT-4 achieved an average of 49.4%, while GPT-3.5 scored 38.6%.\n\n*   **Impact on Weaker Students:** The research paper suggests that given the AI's performance, only weaker students would likely see an improvement in their marks by using these models.\n\n*   **Post-COVID Exam Performance:** The claim about performance on post-COVID exams is also accurate. For exams from 2021-2022, which were adapted for open-book conditions, GPT-4's average score was 47.5%, and GPT-3.5's was 33.6%.\n\n*   **Paper Title:** The title of the paper is correctly stated as \"Exploring Durham University Physics exams with Large Language Models\".\n\n*   **Current AI Limitations:** The study's findings do indicate the current limitations of large language models in the context of university-level physics assessments. The paper notes that neither GPT-4 nor GPT-3.5 pose a significant threat to the integrity of physics assessments at present.\n\nHere is the claim that could not be verified:\n\n*   **Formatting and Old Languages:** There is no information within the research paper to support the assertion that the AI is \"also very good at formatting languages or other old languages.\" The study's focus is squarely on the performance of AI on physics problems.",
