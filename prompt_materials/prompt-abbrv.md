**Objective:** Generate a LaTeX Beamer presentation (slides only, not a full document) for a 30-minute talk (target < 15 slides) to be delivered on 2025-05-20.

**Core Topic & Narrative:**
The talk should focus on showcasing the **Unimpeded software** and its application to results from DiRAC allocations (specifically 'DiRAC 13' completed, 'DiRAC 17' ongoing). A key theme is the **importance of robust cosmological analysis, quantifying tensions (like the curvature tension), and addressing biases (e.g., LCDM bias from fiducial assumptions)**, with Unimpeded presented as a solution or tool in this context. The final few slides should touch upon how advanced AI/LLMs (like the one generating this talk) can contribute to the next stage of cosmological robustness.

**Target Audience:** Cosmoverse workshop (see below)

**Stylistic Guidelines:**
*   Minimal use of overlays (`\pause`, `\onslide`).
*   Use of columns for layout.
*   Bullet points typically in one column.
*   Figures often placed in the other column.
*   Cite arXiv papers using `\arxiv{<arxiv_id>}`.

**Input Materials & How to Use Them:**

1. **Cosmoverse Workshop Details**:

    * Purpose: context on the **audience** and other speakers.
    ```text
    [INSERT cosmoverse.txt]
    ```

2. **Talk abstract:**
   **Purpose:** This is the **main theme** of the talk. Use it to guide the overall structure and flow of the presentation.
   ```text
   [INSERT abstract.txt]
   ```
    
3.  **Old Talk:**
    *   Purpose: Primarily for overall **style, tone, and an example of slide structure.** Identify recurring thematic elements if any, but the content will be new.
    ```tex
    [INSERT old_talk.tex HERE]
    ```

4.  **DiRAC Cases for Support:**
    *   Purpose: Extract key **achievements from DiRAC 13** and **objectives/plans for DiRAC 17.** This provides context for the computational work and how Unimpeded supports or results from these allocations. Frame this as the scientific context/motivation for developing/using Unimpeded.
    *   DiRAC 13:
        ```tex
        [INSERT dirac_13.tex HERE]
        ```

        ```

5.  **ERC Grant Excerpt:**
    *   Purpose: Use this to craft the **motivation/introduction slides** about the importance of quantifying tensions and the bias towards LCDM through fiducial assumptions. This sets the stage for why tools like Unimpeded are necessary.
    ```tex
    [INSERT B2.tex HERE]
    ```

6.  **Survey/Background Papers (for introductory/contextual slides):**
    *   Purpose: Synthesize background material on quantifying tensions, model complexity, suspiciousness in data, and curvature tension.

        ```

7.  **Unimpeded Software Details:**
    *   Purpose: These form the core of the talk, explaining what Unimpeded is, how it works, and its benefits.
    *   Example Script (`example.py`): Use this to illustrate a practical use case or a key feature of Unimpeded on a slide.
        ```python
        [INSERT example.py HERE]
        ```

**Core Narrative Elements to Weave Together:**
- **Context: Cosmological Tensions:** Introduce the problem of tensions in cosmology, referencing the importance of quantifying them.
  - the sociological bias from fiducial assumptions (from `B2.tex`)
  - the computational and conceptual difficulties of developing beyond LCDM codes
  - blinding
    - general criticism of blinding namely that in practice the collaborations that spend substantial fractions of talks celebrating their blinding procedure end up fiddling with their analysis post unblinding.
    - e.g:
    - DESY5
    - ACT DR6
      - show plot explicitly of ns pre and post unblinding 
    - This completely invalidates the blinding process,
- **DiRAC 13 & 17:** Highlight key outcomes and successes from the completed "dirac 13" allocation.
  - discuss scope of dirac 13 run (list of models, list of datasets, mcmc & nested sampling)
  - discuss extension of dirac 17 for the new generation of cosmological datasets (DESI, Euclid, ACT DR6, SPT, Erosita, SNe)
- **Essential concepts**: 
  - quantifying global tensions
  - missing tension by focussing on one parameter
  - erroneous tension by focussing on one parameter
  - systematic tensions
- **Background Material (Survey Papers):** Briefly cover essential concepts from the survey papers (tensions, evidence ratios, model complexity, suspiciousness, curvature tension) to support the main theme.
- **Introducing "unimpeded":** Present the "unimpeded" software â€“ its purpose, how it works (conceptually, drawing from `example.py` and `unimpeded.md`), and its potential to address some of the challenges in quantifying tensions.
- **"Adverts" for Other Relevant Work:** Include 1-2 slides showcasing other relevant research/tools from your portfolio that might interest the audience. These should be distinct from the main "unimpeded" focus but thematically related if possible.
  - blackjax nested sampling for the future of GPU computing
    - whether we like it or not, hardware will be GPU related
    - we have written a new nested sampling (not multinest, polychord, dynesty, ultranest -- trying explicitly to democratise the code by putting it into an open source statistical framework) algorithm in jax
      - https://github.com/williamjameshandley/talks/blob/cosmoverse_2025/blackjax_ns.py
      - depending on your GPU, and your code, this is many orders of magnitude faster
  - SBI for allowing scientists to focus on scientific modelling, not code 
  - LLMs for writing and organising cosmological analyses
    - A capable prompt engineer who understood boltzmann codes could now write a jax CAMB or class in weeks not years. This will only get better.
- **Conclusion & Future Outlook:** Summarize and look ahead.
-  **(Optional, if you want the LLM to draft it):** A final "bonus slide" acknowledging the use of LLMs in preparing the talk (as per your meta-instruction).


**Specific Instructions for Content Generation:**

*   **Populate Slides:** Fill the suggested structure (or an improved one) with content synthesized from all provided materials.
*   **Citations:**
    *   Use `\arxiv{<arxiv_id>}` for citations. This gives a newcommand which hyperlinks to the correct file, so I don't want any other form of link
    *   Extract arXiv IDs from the `.bbl` files or by searching online for titles/DOIs from the `.tex` paper sources.
*   **Figures:**
    *   For background material, use the provided papers to identify where figures would be useful. Where possible use figures from the papers, with the same name, and with a latex comment that indicates which paper it is from. If another figure is needed, insert LaTeX figure environments with placeholders: `\begin{figure}\centering \includegraphics[width=0.X\columnwidth]{placeholder_FIGURE_DESCRIPTION.png} \caption{Descriptive caption for figure about Y}\end{figure}`.
    *   For Unimpeded, suggest and create placeholders for figures that would best illustrate its function, features, or results.
*   **Original Content:** Beyond summarizing, synthesize information to create a coherent narrative. Propose text for connecting ideas, introductions, and conclusions for each section. Use your own knowledge and external search (grounded and verified) to enrich the content where appropriate, especially for general cosmological context.
*   **Emphasis on LLM Showcase:** Ensure the final slides effectively convey the message about LLMs' potential in cosmology, reflecting the effort in this prompt and the expected quality of the output.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Slides should be clear, concise, and visually appealing (within Beamer's capabilities).
*   **Review and Verify:** Critically review all generated material for accuracy and relevance. In particular check that all references are in the form \arxiv{<arxiv_id>}, and **not** of the form `[1, 3]` `[5]` or containing ADS bibcodes or otherwise. Use google search throughout.

**Final Deliverable:**
A single `.tex` file containing only the Beamer frames (`\begin{frame}...\end{frame}`), ready to be included in a main Beamer document.

Please put maximum reasoning effort into this. I would like this to showcase LLMs' capabilities. Stay attentive throughout the generation process, continually reviewing all materials provided and generated, and ensuring that the final output is polished and coherent. Don't hold back.
