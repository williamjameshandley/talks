# AI tools

- 3 providers:
  - Microsoft
    - OpenAI
      - chatGPT 
  - Amazon
    - Anthropic
      - Claude 
  - Google
    - Deepmind
      - Gemini 
- 3 levels of AI tools
  - autocomplete
    - copilot
    - deep tab 9
  - prompt engineering 
    - either one-shot or chat
    - [most people familiar with this]c
  - Agentic systems [emerged onto the market april 2025]
    - claude code 
    - codex
    - gemini
    - deep research
    - ampcode

- Core advice:
  - Don't use chatGPT!
  - use their developer level tools.
    - ChatGPT -> platform.openai.com/playground 
    - claude -> console.anthropic.com/workbench
    - Gemini ->  https://aistudio.google.com/

- Payment 
  - Some tools are 'free':
    - gemini:
      - only by signing away your data
      - limited in the gemini app, much less so in the web app
      - deep research 
  - You can also 'pay as you use'
    - this is orders of magnitude cheaper than a subscription for (most) research use cases if you're using it in chat mode
  - Most also offer a subscription model.
    - this is worth it if you are an  
  - I would recommend having an api-
  - 
  - Do not buy a years subscription
    - the idea that these tools will be the same in a year is ridiculous 

- Core principles:
  - this is a fast changing world.
  - Do not lock yourself into a single provider or tool.
  - Be aware of old-world ways of thinking.
    - The future is not ides, or vim, or jupyter notebooks.
    - The future is being able to talk to these tools. 

- Premier league of models (claude 3.7, gemini 2.5, o3 mini high) emerged in February 2025
  - these operate with many of the capabilities we prize in PhD students and postdocs:
    - writing code
    - summarising and synthesising text
    - mathematical reasoning
    - solving problems
- There is a chasm between free and paid models
  - if your only experience is typing into chatGPT, this is not informative of the capabilities of these tools. 
- If you have not engaged with these tools in anger this year, your lived experience is severly out of date 

- Case study:
  - These things are not stochastic parrots.
    - As senior examiner this year. I got o3 to take the Part II exams:
      - on the day the students were sitting the exam I gave it a prompt "You are a first class Cambridge astronomy student, ... here is the syllabus, ... here is the question, answer it'
      - I got Toby Lovick to transcribe the answers onto written exam scripts
      - We then slipped them into amongst the real scripts and marked blind.
    - Best student we've had across IoA history, even without coursework.

- Advice:
  - These tools are _much_ better at compression, or routine tasks.
  - If you try to get them to do something creative, they need to be heavily supervised.
  - A good use-case is getting the 'scaffold' of a project or paper or grant sketched, and then carefully editing it yourself, or guiding it to edit it.

- Caveat Emptor:
  - These tools are _not_ intelligent in the way humans are
  - Just because they speak, does not mean they think, or learn, like humans.
