# Notes from sandro
- The talk should be aimed at people who have used dynesty, but not necessarily understood how it works, or what the difference is between e.g. dynesty, emcee, or other optimizers: 
  - "We take dynesty, and it's called dynamic nested sampling"
- Ideall we want to cover 'if you want to fit something, what are the different methodologies' and 'what is the difference between sampling and maximisation'
  - chi squared
  - nested sampling
- "SED fitting == SED modelling"
